===================================
2. Supplementary modules/libraries
===================================
 Many modules have been used or created to design the final
 version of usbTinLib. To see constantsUSB and PeriodicThread please
 see below content pages 2.1. and 2.2.
 
 Other useful modules/libraries that have been used are listed below:
 
 - `Python queue module`_: To create MSGqueue and RPSqueue.
 - `Python time module`_: To stabilize some function behaviour
 - `PySerial Library`_: To manage all serial communication.
 
 .. _Python queue module: https://docs.python.org/3/library/queue.html
 .. _Python time module: https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/time.html
 .. _PySerial Library: https://pyserial.readthedocs.org/en/latest/
 
 .. note::
		It is important to point out that the other main module of the global project
		corresponding to the GUI App is not included in this documentation. The
		aim of these documents is to provide a functional knowledge of the usbTinLib.
		CANviewer App only ease even more the use of usbTinLib as it is designed for an 
		intuitive use so no documentations is thought to be necessary.
